As Tulip SMP is invite-only, when you want to welcome someone new to Tulip SMP, you'll have to follow our invite process. This page outlines that process, so you can easily bring new players into our community.

> **Warning:** If you are a member of the general public, you are NOT allowed to ask members to invite you into Tulip SMP. Current members must initiate this process, begging will get you nowhere and you may be perpetually barred from joining in the future.

## Invitation Process

1. Find your player - Make sure that the person you'd like to invite is a good fit for our community. Would they make good friends with you or other people here? Would they agree to our rules? Have them look at our [Guidelines](/guidelines) and make sure they'd be willing to agree to them.
2. Create a Ticket - Click the big green button in the `#tickets` channel of our Discord server (under the "SMP" category). Use "New Player" as the topic of your ticket, then make sure to provide these details:
   - The player's name(s) and pronouns
   - A breif note on their overall personality
   - Why you think they'd be a great fit for Tulip SMP
   - If they'll probably create content on Tulip SMP, links to any applicable profiles where they currently create content
3. Wait for review - An administrator will review your new player ticket, and may ask some questions before we move on to the next step
4. Approval - If an administrator agrees to accept the new player into our community, you are now their "Mentor" until they have been in the server for 1 week. **You must testify in the ticket that your new member has read the following documents:**
   - [Member Guidelines](/guidelines#members)
   - [Conduct Guidelines](/guidelines/conduct)
   - [Client Mod Guidelines](/guidelines/client-mods) (if they use a modded client)
   - [Creator Guidelines](/guidelines/creators#guidelines) (if they intend to create content on or about Tulip SMP)
5. Invitation - Once the previous steps are completed, you'll be given a single-use Discord invite to send to them. **Remember not to share this invite with anyone.**
6. Joining - After the player joins our Discord server, they are fully accepted into our community! You're still their Mentor for 1 week afterwards, so make sure to guide them in the right direction, answer any questions they may have, and introduce them to your fellow players!
