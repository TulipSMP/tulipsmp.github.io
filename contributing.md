# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this documentation, you'll need to do the following things:

1. Learn [Markdown Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). *It's pretty straightforward, and it's the language we use to write these docs, which are automatically rendered into the pretty site you see here.*

2. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com), or sign into your existing one.

3. [Fork the Docs](https://github.com/TulipSMP/tulipsmp.github.io/fork) *(For the uninitiated, this means making your own copy of them, which you can make your changes to).
*

4. Find the file you want to edit in your new fork on GitHub.

5. Click the pencil icon to edit the file, making sure to keep proper grammar (including Oxford commas), spelling (this site is written in US English), and keep in the writing style and formatting of other pages.

6. Once you're done, click *Commit changes*.
