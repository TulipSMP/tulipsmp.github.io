# Conduct Guidelines

- [Back](/guidelines/)

## Preamble

This set of rules guides players as to how they should physically interact with others ingame. All members are bound to these rules.

## Rules

1. Finders Leavers. - *If you find something obviously player-made somewhere, including items, containers, pets and buildings, don't mess with it. You can look around, but don't steal.*
2. Respect Personal Space. - *If someone asks you to leave them alone, or to stop doing something that annoys them, you should comply unless this rule is being used in a bad light.*
3. Spread Out. - *Don't build right next to someone else's space unless they give you permission to, or they have said that anyone can do so. People need space around their builds for them to look nice and be functional, which varies depending on the build, and people need space to get away from other players sometimes. Grant them that.*
4. Don't be a Party Pooper. - *If people are having a good time, don't come in and ruin or disrupt what they're doing just for the sake of it.*
5. Joke Respectfully. - *Practical Jokes are not allowed to impede someone's ingame tasks and buisness, and should remain jokes. If someone asks you to stop or undo what you've done, you should follow that request. If you know that someone may be irritated by such a prank, then don't do it in the first place. Practical Jokes cannot involve theft, greifing, harassment, or any other sort of thing that violates our guidelines.*
