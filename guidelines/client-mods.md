# Client Mod Guidelines

- [Back](/)

## Preamble

This set of Guidelines specifies what kind of Minecraft Mods you are allowed to use on your client while on Tulip SMP. 

### What's Allowed

You are allowed to use mods that modify Minecraft to...

- Look Better or Different
- Perform Better
- Rewrite buggy or unreliable Mojang code
- Make inventory management easier
- Change the lighting for artistic purposes, including "Dynamic Lighting" mods
- Add on-screen widgets with information that is already easily accessible outside of the game (like JEI, and minimaps that don't display more than the official map site).


### What's Not Allowed

You are **NOT** allowed to use mods that modify Minecraft to...

- Be noticeably easier to perform ingame actions, or perform macros (other than Crafting and Inventory management)
- Be able to see or click through blocks that are otherwise not transparent or cannot be reached through (i.e. X-Raying)
- Change how the player can move ingame or interact with the world (other than Mods that allow you to click through Signs or Item Frames to containers)
- Show you statistics or information about a mob or player that is not usually visible in the base game, other than mods like AppleSkin that give you information about your own saturation
