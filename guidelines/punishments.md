# Tulip SMP - Punishment Guidelines

- [Back](/guidelines/)

## About

This page is intended to guide Moderators in making decisions about what punishments to doll out based on rules broken. It is not a list of hard-and-fast rules, and does not take into account repeat offenses.

Repeated offenses should always have somewhat more severe punishments

#### Durations

Exact durations are not listed  here, see this key for their approximation:

Duration | Timespan
---------|---------
Quick    | <1 hr
Short    | <1 day
Medium   | 1-3 days
Long     | 3-5 days
Extended | 5-14 days
Permanent| âˆž minutes

Feel free to [/jail](/docs/commands/#togglejail) people instead of tempbanning them, for cool and poggerness and also its neat for lore.
