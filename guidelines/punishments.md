# Punishment Guidelines

- [Back](/guidelines/)

## About

This page is intended to guide Moderators in making decisions about what punishments to doll out based on rules broken. It is not a list of hard-and-fast rules, and does not take into account repeat offenses.

Repeated offenses should always have somewhat more severe punishments
