# Inviting New Players

- [Back](/)

Tulip SMP welcomes new players, even though we are not fully open to the public. If you are currently a member of Tulip SMP, you may indirectly invite new players via the following process.

1. Find your player: Make sure the person whom you wish to invite would be a goos fit for our community and would be able to keep our [guidelines](/guidelines).

2. Invite them to the **Tulip SMP • Invitations** discord server, where they will be processed. You can find an invite link for this server in the `#info` channel, or by going to *Server Guide* → *How to Join* and scrolling to the bottom.
    > **WARNING:** You may NOT permitted to do any of the following with this invitw link: (1) Post it publicly on the internet, (2) post it anywhere anonymously, (3) send it to people you do not know well enough to know if they are a good fit for our server, or (4) post it where it is against that community's rules to do so.
    >
    > **NOTE** that users you invite will have to recall who specifically sent them the invite. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you **invite users *individually***.
    >
    > *You do not need to join the Tulip SMP • Invitations server yourself.*

3. They will then read the information in the `#info` channel of that discord server, and then open a ticket where they will explain who invited them and why they wish to join.

4. If they are accepted, we will invite them to Tulip SMP as a full member. However, don't be afraid, as rejections are hopefully unlikely.
