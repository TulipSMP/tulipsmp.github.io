## Usage

Using a shopkeeper is quite simple. Just trade with it like a normal villager!

## Setup

Setting up a shopkeeper is only slightly more complex than using it, we've broken it down into a few simple steps:

1. Obtain a shopkeeper from the shopkeeper at spawn.

2. Place a container (i.e. a chest or barrel) near where you want the shopkeeper to be, and click it with the shopkeeper. This is where you store the items to sell, and where the proceeds are placed.

3. Hold the shopkeeper, and click it in the air to change the mob (which you can change later) and the shop type (which cannot be changed later). If you're unsure what kind you want, check out the [Shop Types](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki/Player-Shop-Setup) page on the Shopkeepers wiki.

4. Place the shopkeeper on the floor where you want it to go (you can change this later).

5. Place the items you wish to use in your shop (i.e. to sell/trade/etc.) in the container you selected in step 2.

6. Shift/Sneak while clicking the shopkeeper to open the editing menu. There you can change prices, place in [Placeholder Items](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki/Placeholder-Items) for items you don't have yet, or [edit other aspects of your shop](https://github.com/Shopkeepers/Shopkeepers-Wiki/wiki/Editing-Shops).
