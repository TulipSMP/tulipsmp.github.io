## About

In order to keep your stuff safe, Tulip SMP employs a simple-to-use block locking system, called BlockProt.

You can lock various blocks, including:
- Chests
- Furnaces
- Anvils
- Doors

and more!

## How-To

To lock something, follow these steps:

1. Crouch/Sneak and right-click a lockable block to open the GUI
2. From there, you can lock and unlock the block, add and remove friends who can use that block, along with several other settings.


Additionally, use `/blockprot settings` to manage default settings for blocks you place.
