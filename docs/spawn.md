# Spawn Building

> Note: this page is now useless, season 1 spawn has been built!

Let's build spawn! Here are the technical requirements:
- Be easy to navigate
- Have a place for the shopkeeper to stand to sell shopkeepers
- 4 Jail cells
- Stay 4-way symmetrical and somewhat circular, other than the shopkeeper
- Have spaces for holograms (i.e. floating text)


I have a block pallette already laid out ingame, but encourage everyone to add blocks to it!

I also have worldedit if you need me to do stuff with that, but I'd rather not unless necessary, as it gets messy quickly.
