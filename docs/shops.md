# Shops

- [Back](/docs)

Chest shops are a quick and easy way to sell items for diamonds, even when you're not online to do the trading yourself.

## Creating a Shop

1. Place a chest where you want to have your shop
2. Hold the item you want to sell (if you want to sell multiple at once, hold that many in your hand)
3. Hit the front of the chest with your item, and instructions will appear in chat. Just enter how many diamonds it should cost per unit.
4. Now, anyone can purchase items from your shop by clicking on the sign on the front, and only for the price you specified. Restock by refilling the chest with more of the item you're selling.
