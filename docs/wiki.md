## Creating an Account

To create an account on the wiki, click the person icon in the top right, and then click "Log In". 
Then, click on one of the signin providers below the signin UI, or click "Register".

## Page Formatting

Our wiki uses the CKGEdit plugin for its editor, so you don't need to worry about wiki syntax.

Each page must:
- Start with a full-size heading (which determines the title of the page)
- Be added to the appropriate list page (there is a list of list pages  in the sidebar)

**To add wiki links:**
1. Click the "Link" icon along the top of the editor
1. Select "internal link" as the link type
1. Click the button to open the page selector, and find the page you need to link to (or manually type it, make sure to prefix it with a `:`)
1. Fill in the text to display, and click "Ok"

## Creating Pages

To create a page, type the name of the page in the search bar and hit enter, then (ensuring you're signed in) click the red link at the top of the search results.

From there, you will be redirected to the editor where you can create  the page, following the guidelines for [Page Formatting](#page-formatting).

## Incidents

If something against the rules happens on the wiki, please alert the moderators and we will deal with it. (The moderators do have a log of wiki changes)
