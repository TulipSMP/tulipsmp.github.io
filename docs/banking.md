## How it Works

Your balance is determined from the number of diamonds in your inventory, plus the number of diamonds in your bank account. When you purchase something, diamonds from your bank account are used first, and then diamonds from your inventory. You don't have to ever deposit anything into your account if you don't want to -- just keep some diamonds in your inventory.

## Commands

### Checking Balances
- `/bank` or `/bank balance` or `/bank balance <player>`: get how many diamonds you have, both in your bank account and in your inventory
- `/bank baltop`: get a leaderboard of players, ordered by most wealthy

### Depositing and Withdrawing
- `/bank deposit` or `/bank deposit <number>` or `/bank deposit all`: move diamonds from your hand, a certain number from your inventory, or all your diamonds into your bank account
- `/bank withdraw <amount>` or `/bank withdraw all`: move a certain amount or all of your diamonds from your bank account into your inventory

### Pay or Transfer Funds
- `/bank pay <player> <amount>`: give a certain amount of your diamonds to another player's inventory
- `/bank transfer <player> <amount>`: directly transfer diamonds from your bank account into another player's account
