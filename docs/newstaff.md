## Welcome to the Team!

So, you've been added to the Staff team? Welcome! We're glad to have you.

Before you can start moderating, you'll have to do some reading.


Make sure you've read the [Guidelines](/guidelines) (both the Member and Staff sections) and have no reservations. If you do take issue with these guidelines, please [reach out to me!](https://krafterdev.xyz/socials)


Additionally, you should read the [Punishment Guidelines](/guidelines/punishments) so you know how our punishments are handled on Tulip SMP. 


After you're familiar with the Guidelines, check out the [Staff Guide](staffguide).
