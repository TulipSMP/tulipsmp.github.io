## About 

[Tiramisu](https://github.com/RoseSMP/Tiramisu) is a discord bot written by Krafter and Fizzdev, under the RoseSMP organization. Tulip SMP's instance of Tiramisu is called "Stem".

Instead of using discord-provided user actions and slash commands, it is reccommended to use Tiramisu's ones whenever possible.

Below is the official guide, the latest version can be found in [Tiramisu's Documentation](https://github.com/RoseSMP/Tiramisu/blob/prod/doc/moderator-guide.md). Additionally, you can use the `/help` command in discord and look through various topics for more information on the various features of Tiramisu.

A training manual of sorts for moderators using Tiramisu. It contains all you need to know on how to use Tiramisu's moderation actions


## Slash Commands

Slash commands are the best way to perform moderation actions, as they give you the most control.

```
 * `user`: Select the user to warn
 * `reason`: The reason you are warning them. Sent in warn messages, and in the modlog.

Trigger the [discord-provided timeout feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191-Time-Out-FAQ). Usage:
```
/timeout user:[Select a User] duration:[Select a Time] reason:["No reason given."]
```

/ban user:[Select a User] reason:[Why to ban them] delete_message_days:["0 days'] dm:True
```
 * `user`: Select a user to ban
 * `reason`: Why you are banning the user

 * `dm`: *Optional, Default `True`*; Whether to DM the provided reason to the user

## Context Menu Actions

Another way to perform some actions is by right-clicking users or messages. This provides less options by may be faster or more useful in some circumstances.

To access these actions, go to the *Apps* section of the context menu (availible via right-clicking).

## The Modlog

The modlog (short for Moderator's Log) is a channel where Tiramisu reports all moderation actions it performs. This allows for moderators to stay up to date on what others in their team are doing. 

Have an administrator set the `modlog_channel` setting to an appropriate channel to start seeing logs.
