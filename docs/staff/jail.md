# Jail System

- [Back](/docs/staffguide)

## About

When a user breaks a rule ingame, you can send them to Jail, for added lore effects and pogger epicness.

### How-To

1. Use `/jails` to see the names of available jails
2. Use [`/jail`](/docs/commands/#jail) to put the player in a certain jail, optionally specifying a duration
3. Moderators can then use [`/unjail`](/docs/commands/#unjail) to the player from jail.

> **Note:** While Jr. Moderators can put people in jail, they cannot remove people from jail.
