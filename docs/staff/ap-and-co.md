# Tulip SMP - AuxProtect and CoreProtect

- [Back](/docs/staffguide)

## About

AuxProtect and CoreProtect are two main plugins used to combat theft, loss of items, and greifing. Together, they log nearly everything that occurs within the game, which we can restore and rollback when necessary.

### CoreProtect

CoreProtect primarily is used for inspecting and rolling back changes to the physical world. For more information, view the [CoreProtect Docs](https://docs.coreprotect.net/commands/).

### AuxProtect

AuxProtect is primarily used for restoring items in one's inventory that have been lost. For more information, view the [AuxProtect Wiki](https://github.com/ks-hl/AuxProtect/wiki/Commands).
